# Morse_code_convertor
This Python program converts a user-provided string into its equivalent Morse code representation. The conversion is based on a predefined dictionary of Morse code mappings.

## Features

- Converts uppercase and lowercase alphabets to Morse code.
- Supports all 26 English letters (A-Z).
- Displays the Morse code output as a single string.

## How It Works

1. The program uses a dictionary (`morse_code_dict`) to map each letter to its Morse code equivalent.
2. The user inputs a string.
3. The program converts each letter in the string into Morse code.
4. The final Morse code is displayed as a concatenated string.

## run
save the code in .py file (eg. morse.py)
```bash
python morse.py
```
